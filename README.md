Through the observation of Large-Scale Structures (LSS) of the Universe, it is possible to precisely measure the cosmological parameters of the Standard $\Lambda$-CDM Model. In detail, the Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structures, has proven to be able to determine the $\Lambda$-CDM parameters with great accuracy, taking into account the effects of very small scales on mildly nonlinear scales.\\
In this work, Effective Field Theory of LSS predictions at one-loop order are used to analyse the BOSS full shape of the galaxy Power Spectrum and Correlation Function, with an in-depth analysis of the effects of the prior information on the constraint of cosmological parameters. In fact, a considerable influence is shown by the choice of the prior distribution to be associated both to cosmological and nuisance parameters: this different choice can result, in some cases, in a shift between parameters measured by the same experiment. To alleviate this inconvenience, I developed an algorithmic procedure, integrating supervised and non-supervised Machine-Learning techniques, that allows the effects of this prior difference to be quantified, and possibly removed, with the aim of identifying those parameters that can be said to be successfully data-constrained.
